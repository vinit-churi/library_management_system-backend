This file contains the steps that I followed to complete the task
Step 1 : Analyze the problem statement and device actionable steps.
    => The problem statement is to create a library management web application (high level todo's)
        1. Create a database to store the books and the users
        2. Create a REST API to perform CRUD operations on the database
        3. Create a web application to consume the REST API
Step 2: First start working on building the backend rest api using expressJs for the CRUD operations and mongoose for the database connection to mongoDB.
    Endpoints:
        /books
            GET - To get all the books
        /books/create
            POST - To create a new book
        /books/:id
            GET - To get a book by id
            PUT - To update a book by id
            DELETE - To delete a book by id
        /users/create
            POST - To create a new user
        /users/login
            POST - To login a user
        /users/register
            POST - To register a user
        /users/:id
            GET - To get a user by id
    User permissions:
        1. CREATOR - Can create, update, delete a book.
        2. VIEW_ALL - Can view all the books.
